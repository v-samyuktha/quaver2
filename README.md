# Quaver2
Quaver is back, and it's bigger, and it's better!!!

## What's New?

This time, I have re-made Quaver as a Single-Page WebApp, with the help of VueJS.

Frameworks used include:
- Flask for backend
- VueJS for frontend
- SQLite for database
- Celery for Email Jobs
- Redis-Server for Caching
- Flask-Security for RBAC
